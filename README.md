# chordparser

# [Overview](#overview)

ChordParser is a library for parsing musical chords from a human readable string representation.  
It is inspired by chordSymbol: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/chord-symbol.>  
Said that, it implements its own rules and conventions, which can change in the future since this it is a work in progress project.  
For now, the scope of the library is to parse chords from Pop, Rock, and Jazz music in _relatively standard_[^1] English notation.  
Classical notation, as well as Latin or German notation, is not supported.

# Chord struct

Once parsed the Chord struct can be used to get information about the chord.  
This includes:

- Root note of the chord
- Bass note of the chord if any
- Parsed descriptor of the chord
- Note literals in the chord
- Intervals relative to root note
- Semitones relative to root note
- Whether the chord is a sus chord

The Chord is also serializable into JSON and MIDI and allows transposition from one key to another.

# [Parsing rules](#parsing_rules)

Since there isn't a full consensus on how chords should be written, any chord parser is by definition opinionated.  
The current rules and conventions maybe are too much restrictive, but it should allways be a way to express a chord in a way that the parser (and a human) can understand.  
The main spirit for now is to reject non-standard representations rather than attempting to interpret everything and to focus on parsing the most standarized forms.

For example, we decided to ban the use of `M | Ma | | MA | Maj` or any similar variant (except `Œî`) if is not followed by a 7th or a tension (9, 11, 13, etc. ) because it leads to
some really weird notations like `CMaj(omit5)min7`, which are far away from being standard. This could be written much more clearly as as `C-Maj7(omit5)`.  
As another example, the symbol `Œî` can be used to express a `maj7` chord, regardless of whether it is followed by a 7th.
So in this case we are more permissive since both are common interpretations.
As said, this is a work in progress project and the rules can change in the future.

# [Limitations](#limitations)

- There are currently around 1300 tests, including both failing an accepted cases, this will be improved.
- No string representation of the chord is supported yet beyond the input string.
- Bass symbol is not supported yet.
- Parsed chord notes have enharmonically correct names when possible. For example, a `B#9` chord will have `CùÑ™` as the ninth instead of D. Said that,
  triple flat/sharps are not suported since they add an unnecesasry complexity for very rare use cases.
- When transposed, /bass note may not be enharmonically correct.
- The parser is not customizable for now, but it is expected to be in the future, for example:
  - Include or remove both custom and default validators.
  - Include or remove sets of allowed symbols.
  - Maybe allow other notations like Latin or German.

Checkout the example usage at the examples folder running:

- `cargo run --example parse-chord `
